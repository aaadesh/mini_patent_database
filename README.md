This is a small patent database, runnng on Flask based Web-Interface. It is similar to Google Patents. You can search for a patent and see its details.

First I created a SQL database using the XML file provided by USPTO (https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/patent/grant/redbook/fulltext/2024/ipg240514.zip). I need to scrape more fields from the XML.

Then I built a web-interface using Flask to display the patent data. I sample screenshot is attached.

I kept it small because there is a lot of patent data on USPTO and I have less storage space.
